  description: "A reminder that any work you conduct for the Echelon Institute is
    to be treated with the utmost secrecy- especially those modifying our Calcutron
    Construct. The work we do is too valuable to have accidentally leaked to the
    press. If anyone inquires about what you do, please reply with the standard \u201CI
    work for a think tank.\u201D This is technically the truth, if you have any compunctions
    about lying. If you believe any of your coworkers may be attempting to expose
    our operations to public scrutiny, please alert your superiors at once. Remember
    that you are working towards a better future."
