  description: "As staff are likely aware, Operation 8450 is getting some unwanted
    attention in the media. Polling indicates that certain aspects of 8450 are \u2018toxic\u2019
    to large swathes of the voting public, so we\u2019d like to advise our affiliated
    candidates to publicly distance themselves from the Operation, regardless of
    their stance on the actual policies therein. After the election, it won\u2019t
    really matter if they\u2019re caught lying, they will have been elected.  The
    exception to this is our slate of anti-magic proposals; ad-buys can continue
    on this topic. Polling conducted by our 33rd Street division indicates that we
    can capitalize on public distrust of magic users and seize major gains, provided
    they are accompanied by appropriately large ad expenditures. We have reason to
    believe we can nail our opponents on this topic. If our candidates are accused
    of bigotry, please use the prepared \u201Cjust raising community concerns\u201D
    and \u201Csimply asking common sense questions\u201D rhetoric outlined in our
    previous Talking Points Bulletin. Good Luck Team! -Echelon Institute PR "
