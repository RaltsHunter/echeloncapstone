  description: "Team- As we prepare our move to the business district, we\u2019d
    like to inform you that the warehouse will be on high alert with additional security
    personnel in the next couple days. I know we\u2019re mostly guarding records
    and old equipment, but the higher ups would rather we not let anything fall into
    outside hands. The Calcutron robot WILL be deployed in a security role until
    our move is complete, so please make sure you have your clearance IDs on you
    at all times. Thank you for your service -Col. Aubrey, Security Division "
