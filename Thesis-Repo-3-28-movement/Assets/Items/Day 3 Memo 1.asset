  description: "Memorandum: All Echelon Institute Employees RE: Business District
    Office \tIn recent days a number of raids have occurred on more than one Institute
    facility. Our security forces have assessed the situation and have decided that
    all operations not located within the home office are to be immediately redirected
    to the satellite office in the business district. It is our belief that by consolidating
    our resources there, we should be able to prevent further leaks until after the
    election; this move includes any infiltrators we\u2019ve caught. We are unsure
    if the raids we have experienced are the work of one organization or multiple
    cells, but it is imperative that we not allow them to hinder our work. The moral
    fabric of this country is on the line, and we are its protectors. Together, once
    we\u2019ve won this election, we\u2019ll see Operation 8450 implemented, and
    this country saved. God bless America. - The Board of Directors "
