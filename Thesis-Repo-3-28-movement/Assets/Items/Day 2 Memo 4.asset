  description: 'I understand the security concerns raised by the director, and to
    address those concerns, security at the warehouse has been equipped with state
    of the art body armor that is resistant to magical assault. We have retrofitted
    the armaments of our security squads to utilize the best of modern technology,
    to counter the enhanced skills of combatants with magical abilities. We anticipate
    a 23% increase in combat effectiveness against magic users, allowing us to go
    toe-to-toe with the best. Please reach out if you have any other concerns. -Col.
