  description: 'Combat Readiness Report: Calcutron Mech -Col. Aubrey, Security Division,
    reporting This should be my last communique on the matter. After numerous tests,
    we have determined that the modified Calcutron robot in our possession is operating
    at 100% combat efficiency. Its most recent suite of OS upgrades have massively
    improved its effectiveness- by turning the full extent of its mathematical processes
    towards battle analysis, it has proven itself as more than a match for anything
    we can throw at it (and on that matter, we will need to send condolence letters
    to the families of the three most recent test volunteers). It is, however, concerningly
    susceptible to overheating due to the energy expenditures of its battle analysis.
    We recommend developing a cooling system to keep it in optimal fighting condition
    longer.  As it stands, the modified Calcutron should serve as an excellent demo
    product for the military, particularly for the purposes of deployment against
    the magical elements in our communities. '
