  description: "Hey James, Unfortunately, given the off-the-books nature of the warehouse,
    I\u2019m afraid our claims assessor can\u2019t do anything about the stolen and/or
    destroyed goods from there, as they were not properly insured. The Institute
    is gonna have to eat the costs of those lost items. I know some heads are probably
    gonna roll over this, and I\u2019m really sorry if yours is one of them, but
    there\u2019s simply nothing we can do over here at legal. Next time, maybe the
    Board of Directors will remember we\u2019re a think tank and not a spy organization.
    We do things above board for a reason. -Pete Peter Holmes, Legal "
